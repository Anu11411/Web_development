    <h2>Coffee Roasting</h2>
  <h3>  Why is roasting important – or is it?</h3>
<p>Coffee beans are seeds matured in coffee cherry. They are then processed and dried to coffee beans. Before roasting, coffee beans are green in color and have a beany and grassy aroma. Actually, green coffee beans do not smell like coffee at all. When we roast coffee, we develop 800 to 1000 different aroma compounds. These compounds make the flavour of the coffee. With roast profiling, we can affect the existence of these aroma compounds in coffee and also determine the flavour of the coffee.
</p>
 <h3>Coffee roasting process</h3>
<p>Roasting means transforming coffee beans from green to brown. There are different ways to make it, and that affects the flavour. I will here discuss the principals of roasting and commercial roasting. Read about the different ways to roast coffee at home from Tomi’s blog.
</p>
<h3>Roasting stages</h3>
<p>There are three main stages in roasting: drying stage, browning stage and development stage or roasting stage.

<dt><strong>1. DRYING STAGE</strong></dt>
<dd>The coffee bean has a humidity of 8–12%. We need to dry it before the actual roasting starts. Drying stage typically lasts 4–8 minutes with traditional drum roaster (see below for roaster designs). The temperature in the end of drying stage is typically 160 ⁰C. Especially with drum roasters, you need to be careful so that you do not burn the beans by having too much heat in the start. The drying stage is also important for collecting energy for the bean because the last stage of roasting is exothermic (heat producing).

<dl><strong> <dt>2. BROWNING STAGE</strong><dt>
<dd>From 160 ⁰C the coffee starts to smell like toasted bread and hay. This is when the aroma precursors are starting to convert to aroma compounds. Even though browning stage is after drying stage, drying continues during the browning stage.
At the browning stage starts the Maillard reaction that is responsible for browning. In Maillard reaction, reducing sugars and amino acids react making hundreds of different aroma and color compounds known as melanoids. This is the stage when the roast naturally slows down – and some roastmasters also want to slow it down – to ensure flavour development. In the end of browning stage the coffee starts to pop. This is called the first crack and the development stage starts.
</dd>
<dl>
<dt><strong>3. DEVELOPMENT OR ROASTING STAGE</strong></dt>
<dd>In the beginning of development stage the reaction becomes exothermic and the coffee cracks. During drying and browning stages the bean has collected energy that makes the coffee to explode. Development time is when the wanted aroma compounds are developing. If we do not slow down the roast at development stage, we easily get coffee that is smoky tasting and the flavour is too sharp.</dd>
